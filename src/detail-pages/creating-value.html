<h2 class="h3">by improving soil health, we reduce the use of costly inputs</h2>
<br>
<p>
A healthy soil is composed of a functioning microbial ecosystem that more efficiently uses nutrients, builds soil structure, and combats pathogen pressure. The benefit of building a healthier soil is thus directly linked to reductions in fertilizer applications, water usage, and agrochemicals. 
</p>

<p>
Additionally, healthier soil does not just function as a carbon sink, but it is more tolerant to climate variations, an issue that is becoming more prevalent each day.
</p>


<h2 class="h3 margin-top-2000">our enhanced nutrient pathways lead to increased yields</h2>
<br>
<p>
Our customized biological solutions reintroduce site specific microorganisms responsible for Macro- and Micro-nutrient mineralization.
</p>

<p>
These microorganisms access nutrients and minerals that would otherwise be inaccessible to the plant, releasing them directly into the root zone as the plant needs them. 
</p>

<p>
The steadily available stream of nutrient production allows the crop to grow with vigor and yield its greatest potential.
