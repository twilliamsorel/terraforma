A plant is quite simple in theory – it requires the sunlight, water, and nutrients. If sufficient amounts of the essentials are provided, the plant will flourish.

In row crops, there isn’t much you can do about sunlight, and so we turn our focus to what we can control -- your Soil.

While Soil Health and Soil Productivity are not synonymous, they are without doubt correlated. While both intensive nutrient/water management and increased biological functionality can be highly productive systems, intensive management strategies can often degrade soil health making it difficult to maintain productivity over the long term.

[\[MS1\]](#_msoanchor_1)I think I get what you’re going for here. They both increase productivity, but one requires costly nutrient and water management and the other works through biological functionality which has no cost. (for simplicity, sure no cost, but maybe less cost – cause Terrapods ain’t free)

I would consider restructuring the sentence, right now I read it as “The difference is that a soil may be more productive with intensive nutrient/water management, but a healthy soil will have a higher biological functionality, which has a profound benefit to plant productivity without cost to the farmer. [\[MS1\]](#_msoanchor_1)“

Basically, my brain registers this as “the difference is productivity between intensive and biological.” But they both increase productivity so there isn’t a difference, cost kind of just sneaks in there at the end and isn’t mentioned for intensive.
